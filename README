Convert-TimeUnits version 0.01
==============================

Convert::TimeUnits is a Perl module that simplifies units(1)-esque conversions
of time units via both functional and object-oriented interfaces. The functional
interface provides simple unit_to_other-unit conversion functions suitable for
quick conversions. The object-oriented interface provides field accessors and
methods to convert all fields to the requested unit and tally those values,
returning the total. For the sake of consistency, all units referenced in
Convert::TimeUnits -- whether field names or function / method names -- are
pluralized. Negative values are not permitted. Integer, floating point, and
overflow (e.g. seconds > 60) values are all valid. The constants for this
program were obtained from the units program as shipped with FreeBSD 5.2.1.
Preliminary tests reveal no discrepancies with GNU units though contrary reports
are always welcome.

All methods and functions contained in Convert::TimeUnits perform extensive
error testing before performing their specific tasks. Due to the importance of
time in today's society and the required accuracy of time-based calculations,
all errors are fatal and use croak (and thus Convert::TimeUnits requires the
Carp module, a standard Perl module since before version 5.00_5).
